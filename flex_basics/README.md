# FLEX BASICS

In this demo I try to demonstrate the proper use of flex. Many times my students strugle at the beggining with the idea of which element receives the flex property. Here we can see that if we try to align two block elements one next to another, we should use the flex property in the parent element not on each element we want to align.
