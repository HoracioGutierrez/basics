# CENTER HORIZONTAL MARGIN 

In this demo I try to explain how to properly apply the margin to an element to center it. The idea is to make sure one uses the automatic margin on the element one wants to align in the X axis only if there's space left next to it inside the tag the element's in. Most students tend to think sometimes that they have to use the margin : auto in the container element because it's a div/section usually and they see that it reaches the entire screen which they interpret as "remaining space" but it's the other way around, it's the space there's left next to an element. For that to happen, said element's width has to be less than the container element and the browser window at least.
